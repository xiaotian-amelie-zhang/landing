		<h2>Personal Statement</h2>
		<p>
			The role of personal statements is to make candidates stand out from the other applicants. Countless applications list many of the same qualifications and experiences as well as similar goals. Creating a personal statement which is notable for its content requires a great deal of preparation and planning. Personal statements need to be meticulously organized, well-written and focused on setting the applicant apart from the larger group. Whether the personal statement includes an effort to disclose or explain a misstep along the way or to communicate the applicant’s all-encompassing passion for the degree program or specialty, the content must be clear, the ideas must flow well, and it must be in the applicant’s own voice and words.
		</p>

		<h2>Mock Interview</h2>
		<p>
			Properly preparing for a grad school interview is an important part of the graduate school application process. Without proper preparation, you may not get accepted into one of your top choice schools. After putting in the effort to do well as an undergraduate, then research and narrow down the choices in graduate programs, it makes sense to do your best to arrive at your interview ready to impress. 
		</p>
		<h2>VIP Services</h2>
		<p>
			Some artists will provide their ultimate fans with exclusive VIP packages for an unforgettable concert experience. Packages will be different form artist to artist. Each may include front row tickets, an autograph or a pre-show party. Some may even include the opportunity for a meet and greet with the artist or experience a sound check!
